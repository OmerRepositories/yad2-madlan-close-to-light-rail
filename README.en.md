# Light Rail Proximity — Chrome extension for Yad2, Madlan, and Facebook

[עברית](./README.md)

The extension displays useful indicators on real-estate listings in search results and on listing pages:

- **Light rail distance**: `450 m` · `🚶 ~7 min walk · 🚉 Dizengoff`
- **Price per square meter**: `₪28,800` · `−12% from the page median`
- `⭐ Worth checking` — highlights listings that meet all enabled criteria.

Clicking an exact-distance badge opens a new Google Maps tab with walking directions from the address to the station. Approximate locations do not open Maps, to avoid showing a misleading point.

Colors: green up to 600 m · yellow up to 1.5 km · gray for farther distances. `≈` means the location is approximate.

## Installation (Developer mode)

1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable **Developer mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `lightrail-ext` directory.
4. If the extension is already installed, click its reload button and refresh the website.

## License and terms

Use of the extension is subject to the [license and terms of use](./LICENSE.en.md). The Hebrew version is available in [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md).

## Settings

Click the extension icon in Chrome's toolbar. Settings are saved automatically and applied to open pages:

- **Maximum price per square meter (₪)** — for example, `30000`. `0` or blank disables the limit.
- **At least this percentage below the page median** — `0` disables this rule.
- **Require proximity to light rail** and set the **maximum distance** from a station.
- **Yad2 and Madlan calculations** — independently turn off price-per-square-meter or light-rail calculations. The corresponding badge is hidden, the calculation is skipped, and its criteria are ignored when highlighting listings.
- **Highlight good listings** — displays a badge and orange outline when all enabled requirements are met.
- **Brokerage is less preferred** — highlights mentions of brokerage and real-estate terms; Yad2's agent label above the price is highlighted too. Positive phrases such as “without brokerage” are shown as positive.
- **Always remove brokerage listings** — automatically hides listings detected as brokerage. Alternatively, use the compact floating button at the bottom-left of a search page to hide them only for the current page; this temporary filter is not retained after a refresh.
- **Always remove projects** — hides project cards, including Yad2 `/yad1/project/` links and Madlan `/projects/` links, on regular search pages. Filtering is disabled on project catalog pages such as `/yad1` and `/projects-for-sale/`, so their projects remain visible. The floating bottom-left button can apply this only to the current page.
- **Disable the extension on selected sites** — independently disable Yad2, Madlan, or Facebook. When disabled, the extension removes its badges and highlights and stops observing the page. The preference is saved, and changes apply to already-open pages.
- **Required listing amenities** — choose parking, secure room (Mamad), elevator, storage, air conditioning, accessibility, balcony, solar water heater, bars, garden, and pool. Missing amenities are shown as an alert on a listing page and prevent the listing from being marked as worth checking. Unknown amenities are reported as unverifiable. Mamad is selected by default.
- **Madlan extraction** — listing cards use Madlan's structured price, area, and room fields, image address, and hydrated listing address/coordinates when available. Searches spanning multiple areas are not treated as having a single city; missing precise address/location data is not presented as an exact address.
- **Listing and project cache for Yad2 and Madlan** — listing visits store amenities, price, area, price per square meter, room count, available listing creation/update dates, coordinates, approximate rail distance, and brokerage detection. Project pages store available project details and price/area ranges. The cache tab lets you view and edit saved records, and export to CSV or a formatted Excel workbook with listing/project type, filters, clickable links, yes/no indicators, and rail distance/estimate status. Saving new data can be disabled; existing data remains until cleared. Up to 2,500 records and approximately 4 MiB are retained; old records are removed automatically. **Clear saved data** removes only the cache, not user settings.

All enabled criteria must be met for a listing to be highlighted as worth checking.

## Facebook

On the main feed page of a Facebook group only (for example, `facebook.com/groups/370244223604031`), the extension tries to identify properties offered for sale from the post text, property details, and a price or area. It does not analyze the general feed, profiles, or individual post pages. Posts are free-form, so classification is an estimate:

- **Price**: `2,500,000` · `2.5 מיליון` · `2.5M` · `950 אלף` · `מיליון וחצי`
- **Area**: `95 מ"ר` · `גודל 80` · `80 מטר מרובעים`
- **Address**: a street and house number, optionally with a city, for example `הרצל 12 פתח תקווה`
- Rental posts are excluded from purchase analysis. Phrases such as “for rent,” “monthly rent,” or “per month,” as well as a low currency amount typical of rent (for example `₪7,700`), produce a notice that the rental is not relevant to a purchase search.
- “Looking for an apartment/property” posts are excluded and receive a separate notice.
- Marketing copy such as “Looking for your next home?” is not automatically treated as a home-seeker post when property details and seller signals (such as a sale price or viewing invitation) identify a listing.
- Phone numbers are not treated as prices.
- Facebook distance is calculated only when a street and house number are explicitly identified (for example, `רחוב צה״ל 30`). A city alone or a street without a number is not used to guess an address, to avoid misleading locations.
- If price, area, or address is missing, the badge indicates what could not be found.

## How it works

- **Addresses**: Yad2 and Madlan are parsed using known site structures and listing data first. If those are unavailable, the extension falls back to general text parsing. The search context can supply a missing city.
- **Yad2 amenities**: the parking count in “More details” is also considered; a count greater than zero confirms parking even if the parking icon is disabled.
- **Yad2 location**: exact coordinates read on a listing page are cached with its amenity check and reused on search cards for that listing, avoiding street-level geocoding estimates.
- **Price per square meter**: price divided by area, compared with the median of listings on the page. A listing page uses the last saved search median when available.
- **Stations**: sourced from OpenStreetMap (Overpass) and cached for one week.
- **Lazy processing**: listing calculations start as cards approach the viewport.
- **Storage**: preferences are stored separately in `chrome.storage.sync`; listing checks are stored locally in `chrome.storage.local` and are not synced.
- **Geocoding**: exact coordinates provided by a listing are preferred. Otherwise, Nominatim (OSM) is queried. When a house number is requested, a result with a different number is rejected; a street-level fallback is marked approximate. Requests are rate-limited to comply with the service policy.
- **Distance**: straight-line distance to the nearest station; estimated walking time is distance × 1.3 ÷ 80 m/min.

## Troubleshooting

- **Address not found** — hover over the distance badge to see which addresses were searched.
- **Price per square meter unavailable** — the badge indicates whether price or area could not be extracted.

## Notes

- Yad2 and Madlan may change their page structures. Site-specific parsers are in `yad2.js` and `madlan.js`; shared extraction helpers are in `parse.js`; Facebook post classification and group-page scoping are isolated in `facebook-classifier.js` and `facebook-page.js`; Facebook UI/DOM handling is in `fb.js`; coordinate and Maps helpers are in `location.js`.
- The median is most meaningful when the results are for a single city or neighborhood.
- New or under-construction stations may not yet appear in OpenStreetMap.

## Releases

Releases are created automatically when a commit is pushed to `main` with a `manifest.json` version higher than the latest release. The version must use `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format. Each release includes a ZIP archive of the extension.
